# Project 2 - Exploratory Data Analysis

## Business Case:

#### Your hometown mayor just created a new data analysis team to give policy advice, and the administration recruited you via LinkedIn to join it. Unfortunately, due to budget constraints, for now the "team" is just you...

#### The mayor wants to start a new initiative to move the needle on one of two separate issues: high school education outcomes, or drug abuse in the community.

#### Also unfortunately, that is the entirety of what you've been told. And the mayor just went on a lobbyist-funded fact-finding trip in the Bahamas. In the meantime, you got your hands on two national datasets: one on SAT scores by state, and one on drug use by age. Start exploring these to look for useful patterns and possible hypotheses!

## Directions
#### This project is focused on exploratory data analysis, aka "EDA". EDA is an essential part of the data science analysis pipeline. Failure to perform EDA before modeling is almost guaranteed to lead to bad models and faulty conclusions. What you do in this project are good practices for all projects going forward, especially those after this bootcamp!

#### This lab includes a variety of plotting problems. Much of the plotting code will be left up to you to find either in the lecture notes, or if not there, online. There are massive amounts of code snippets either in documentation or sites like Stack Overflow that have almost certainly done what you are trying to do.

## Requirements
#### Materials must be in a clearly commented Jupyter notebook.

#### Students should demonstrate the ability to:

####      -   Analyze diverse datasets & explicitly state your assumptions.
####      -   Form hypotheses and justify them with solid statistical testing in NumPy.
####      -   Visualize and interpret your plots using Matplotlib and Seaborn.
