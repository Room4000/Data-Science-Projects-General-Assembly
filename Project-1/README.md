## Project 1

### Title:  Building "Pokemon Stay"

### Business Case:

#### You are an analyst at a "scrappy" online gaming company that specializes in remakes of last year's fads.

#### Your boss, who runs the product development team, is convinced that Pokemon Go's fatal flaw was that you had to actually move around outside. She has design mock-ups for a new game called Pokemon Stay: in this version players still need to move, but just from website to website. Pokemon gyms are now popular online destinations, and catching Pokemon in the "wild" simply requires browsing the internet for hours in the comfort of your home.

#### She wants you to program a prototype version of the game, and analyze the planned content to help the team calibrate the design.
