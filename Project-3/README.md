# Project 3

## Title:  Regression and Classification with Ames Housing Data

## Business Case: 

#### You have just joined a new "full stack" real estate company in Ames, Iowa. The strategy of the firm is two-fold:

#### Own the entire process from the purchase of the land all the way to sale of the house, and anything in between.
#### Use statistical analysis to optimize investment and maximize return.
#### The company is still small, and though investment is substantial the short-term goals of the company are more oriented towards purchasing existing houses and flipping them as opposed to constructing entirely new houses. That being said, the company has access to a large construction workforce operating at rock-bottom prices.

#### This project uses the Ames housing data recently made available on kaggle.

## Directions
#### Though the housing data for this project is very rich, it is not trivial to clean and prepare for modeling. Good EDA, cleaning, and feature engineering will be critical to the success of your models. Always remember to think critically about the data before modeling. The computer can't be the researcher for you!

#### The first two parts of the project are regression problems. There are potentially hundreds of features and plenty of multicollinearity, so regularization is definitely recommended.

#### The second question involves fitting a regression on the residuals of the first model. This is a practice that "covaries out" any effects of the predictors in the first model before investigating the effects of predictors in the second model.

#### The third section of the project is more challenging and involves dealing with significant class imbalance. This is a common and tricky problem in real-world classification tasks. We leave it up to you to decide how you want to tackle this problem and devise a solution, and highly recommend doing your own research into the topic.

#### We will be looking for the following things:

####  -   Detailed EDA with justification for the steps. Visualize your data with pandas, matplotlib, or other plotting libraries.  
####      Explain the variables you choose for your models.
####  -   Detail your choice of regression and classification models for the task. Include Markdown explaining your justification, results, and interpretation of your models. Make sure your code is clean and clear.
####  -   Remember to frame your results according to your goals outlined in the project prompts.


## Requirements
####  Materials must be in a clearly commented Jupyter notebook

####  You should demonstrate the ability to:

####  - Analyze a complex dataset & explicitly state your assumptions.
####  - Clean, impute, and explore the dataset.
####  - Justify your modeling choices and feature engineering.
####  - Plot, visualize, and interpret your data logically.
####  - Clearly outline your modeling strategy in response to the questions
####  - Explain your results to a technical audience.
